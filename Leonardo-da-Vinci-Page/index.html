                    <article>
                        <p>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 - 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the
                            High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist,
                            sculptor, and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter,
                            he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of
                            subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology.
                            Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works
                            compose a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger
                            contemporary, Michelangelo.</p>

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Leonardo was born in the town of Vinci, Italy on April 15, 1452. Not much is known about his
                    childhood other than his father was wealthy and had a number of wives. About the age of 14 he became
                    an apprentice to a famous artist named Verrocchio. This is where he learned about art, drawing,
                    painting and more.</p>
                <h2>Leonardo the Artist</h2>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci is regarded as one of the greatest artists in history. Leonardo excelled in many
                    areas including drawing, painting, and sculpture. Although we don't have a lot of his paintings
                    today, he is probably most famous for his paintings and also gained great fame during his own time
                    due to his paintings. Two of his most famous paintings, and perhaps two of the most famous in the
                    world, include the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper.</p>
                <p>Leonardo's drawings are also quite extraordinary. He would keep journals full of drawings and
                    sketches, often of different subjects that he was studying. Some of his drawings were previews to
                    later paintings, some were studies of anatomy, some were closer to scientific sketches. One famous
                    drawing is the Vitruvian Man drawing. It is a picture of man who has perfect proportions based off
                    the notes from the Roman architect Vitruvius. Other famous drawings include a design for a flying
                    machine and a self portrait.</p>
                <h2>Leonardo the Inventor and Scientist</h2>
                <p>Many of da Vinci's drawings and journals were made in his pursuit of scientific knowledge and
                    inventions. His journals were filled with over 13,000 pages of his observations of the world. He
                    drew pictures and designs of hang gliders, helicopters, war machines, musical instruments, various
                    pumps, and more. He was interested in civil engineering projects and designed a single span bridge,
                    a way to divert the Arno River, and movable barricades which would help protect a city in the case
                    of attack.</p>
                <p>Many of his drawings were on the subject of anatomy. He studied the human body including many
                    drawings on muscles, tendons, and the human skeleton. He had detailed figures of various parts of
                    the body including the heart, arms, and other internal organs. Leonardo didn't just study the human
                    anatomy either. He also had a strong interest in horses as well as cows, frogs, monkeys, and other
                    animals.</p>
